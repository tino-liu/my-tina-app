> These instructions assume you've already deployed your site – if you created it with the TinaCloud QuickStart, this has all been done for you.

Let's get to grips with the **no-code editing workflow** in production.

## First Steps…

1. You'll need a GitHub account, if you don't have one – create one and come back.
2. Add your account to the project in TinaCloud (or ask your admins to add you).

## Making Edits

1. Go to the [/admin](/admin#/~/docs/tinadocs-and-tinacms/editing-content) route of your website
2. Change the content in one of the fields and watch your site preview update in real time. This is called **visual editing**.
3. Press save.

    This will automatically trigger an update to your site, unless you have [editorial workflow](https://tina.io/editorial-workflow) features enabled (giving teams a Git based approval workflow).
  </>}

> **Note:** these kinds of updates shouldn't create any downtime, depending on your deployment pipeline.

## Editing a Specific Page

### Collections Menu

You can either look through all your pages via the **collections menu**, or turn on edit mode for a specific page.

To go to the collections menu, go to your [/admin](/admin) route, then open the sidebar and follow the below graphic.

Clicking on any of the above documents will take you to the visual editor for that page.

### By URL

Alternatively, you can access the editor for a page you're on by updating the url.

Between the **domain** and **the path** of the page you want to edit, add `/admin/#/~/` to take you to the live editor for that page.![](</img/docs-assets/edit-route-navigation.png> "Going to the edit route on a particular URL")

## Adding a New Page

To create a new doc, go to the Docs collection and click “Add File”.

Folders can be organised as you see fit, and this file path controls the url of that document.

> For example, a document, `A.mdx` in the folder `/B` can be accessed at `DOMAIN/docs/B/A`.

<Callout

    All documents will be exposed, regardless of whether they're included in the navigation bar or not.
  </>}
  variant="warning"

## Managing the Navigation Bar

Docs are organised in tabs and then menus within each tab.

You can manage this from the Navigation Bar collection.

### Adding a New Tab

When adding a new tab, there are two options – either an API tab and a Docs tab.

* **Docs Tab** – allows you to reference documents in a tree structure to create a navigation structure.
* **API Tab** – includes the option to add auto-generated documents from an OpenAPI spec to your sidebar, in addition to regular documents.

<Callout

    Currently, saving the Navigation Bar collection will re-generate these API Tab documents.

### Menu Structure Changes

The menu structure is controlled as an tree-like object inside each Tab.

At each level of the menu, you can choose between a sub-menu or a document file to create the nested navigation structure.

Documents are labelled in the sidebar based on their title field, and menu groups can be given custom names.

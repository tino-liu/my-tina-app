[TinaCMS](https://tina.io) is a Headless Git-backed CMS for developers.

<Callout
  body={<>
    A headless CMS is a tool that stores content and sends it to any website or app through an API, without controlling the frontend implementation.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>

It lets you build a custom content editing portal using React, with changes stored as flat files and committed straight to Git.

This exists separately to your website, which hooks into TinaCMS and pulls that content from Git (see below).

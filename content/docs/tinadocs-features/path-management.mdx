TinaDocs utilizes **NextJS** to create your sitemap at build time.

By default, the relative URL is controlled by the filepath of each document, with one special case for the home route.

<Callout
  body={<>
    With access to the code, static builds can be modified to select the path based on other factors, such as the navigation bar.
    
    This is controlled in `/src/app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx`.
  </>}

/>

## Choosing Paths

It's easiest to choose the filepath for a document at time of creation. Select “Add File” in the Collections menu from the directory where you want your new file located.

See the simple example below.

<fileStructure
  fileStructure={[
    { id: "c1sbhudkd", name: "content", type: "folder", parentId: null },
    { id: "zgmygdri2", name: "docs", type: "folder", parentId: "c1sbhudkd" },
    { id: "zualtmn8t", name: "file-a.mdx", type: "file", parentId: "zgmygdri2" },
    {
      id: "hs6l2trxy",
      name: "subsection",
      type: "folder",
      parentId: "zgmygdri2"
    },
    { id: "0z5fdtnn4", name: "file-b.mdx", type: "file", parentId: "hs6l2trxy" },
    { id: "lm7t4d4p6", name: "src", type: "folder", parentId: null },
    { id: "qgv8bk8n4", name: "tina", type: "folder", parentId: null },
    { id: "tmc6ek24f", name: "package.json", type: "file", parentId: null }
  ]}

As per the above (note that `.mdx` extensions are automatically stripped from URLs)…

* the document `file-a.mdx` is accessible at `/docs/file-a`
* the document `file-b.mdx` is accessible at `/docs/subsection/file-b`

<Callout
  body={<>
    You can also have multiple files with the same name in different directories.
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>

## The Home Route

The file at `/content/docs/index.mdx` is handled independently and serves as the landing page.

This will be statically built at `/docs` (home route) of your project.

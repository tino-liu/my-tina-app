TinaDocs includes features to auto-generate docs pages based on an OpenAPI spec.

You can also choose to use the same components to create API pages manually.

## Upload a Specification

There's a unique collection for storing OpenAPI specifications, and they can be managed independently.

## Using Specification Data

You can read from the specification inline via the API Reference component or generate sections of the nav-bar based on available routes.

### Inline

Select a schema from the dropdown, and all routes will be shown – you can further select a singular route to be used for the component.

### Page Generation

You can generate entire directories to match your spec – marked and colour coded based on route.

1. Create a Tab with the “API Tab” Template.
2. Create a Supermenu Group with the “Group of API References” Template.
3. Choose the spec to be used, and check endpoints to be included.
4. Press save for generation.

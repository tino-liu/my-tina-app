Markdown natively contains some key elements including images, tables, lists, etc.

These have been styled when parsed into your page to match the overall theme.

## Text Formatting

With the base editor we can add [links](/), **bold**, *italic* and ~~strikethrough~~ formatting.

### Inline Code

Using a singular backtick we can wrap small bits of `code`.

## Lists

Lists in markdown are indicated with `*`, `-` or `1.`.

We can order our lists:

1. First Item
2. Second Item

Our keep them unordered:

* First Item
* Second Item

## Block-quotes

Proceed a line with > to create a block-quote.

> Block-quotes are useful to give tips or notes.

## Tables

The markdown syntax for tables is as below.

```
| Feature    | Free Plan | Pro Plan |
| -----------| ----------| ---------|
| Hosting    | ✓         | ✓        |
| API Access | ✗         | ✓        |
| Support    | Email     | Priority |
```

However, TinaCMS' extension of PlateJS allows you to skip manual styling and created tables via the toolbar.

| Feature     | TinaCMS          | Others            |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Cool Team   | ✓                | ✗                 |
| Open Source | ✓                | ✗                 |
| Mascot      | Super cool llama | Nothing, probably |

## Images

When editing, click on the picture icon in the toolbar and you'll be able to upload, select, and pick from images in your repositories media library.

Click into the image to manage alt text and captions.

Users can click on the image in your documentation to view a full-screen version for accessibility.

You can also embed YouTube videos in your documentation site.

Click on the three dots in your tool-bar, click 'Embed' and select YouTube video.

You can click into these embed objects to modify their fields (i.e Video URL, Captions etc)
